## About Course

### Build fast, flexible backends with Express.js

Express is the most popular Node.js framework—and for good reason. It streamlines backend development so you can build powerful APIs and dynamic server-side features with ease. In this project-based course, you’ll learn how to set up Express, design scalable routes, handle data, and implement real-time functionality.

### What is Express.js?

Express is a minimalist framework that runs on top of Node.js. While Node lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, Express gives you a toolkit to build web servers, APIs, and dynamic apps with ease. It takes care of the repetitive parts—like routing, parsing, and middleware—so you can focus on building features that matter.

### What you'll build

This course is project-based, so you’ll learn by building two exciting apps:

#### **Startup Planet**

A REST API packed with detailed information about startups from around the world.. You'll learn how to:

- Create routes to serve different types of data

- Handle HTTP requests and responses

- Serve and filter data using Express

#### **Spiral Sounds**

An indie rock vinyl store where users can browse, order, and get real-time updates. You'll build features including:

- User authentication and protected routes

- Inventory management and order processing

- Task queues for simulating logistics

- Real-time notifications using Server-Sent Events

### What you’ll learn

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to:

- Serve static and dynamic pages

- Craft complex routing systems

- Build middleware

- Handle file uploads and processing

- Work with Event Emitters and Server-Sent Events

- Work with authentication using sessions
